## Execution Flow

0. Language Listing
    - To get the list of available languages, use `list_languages()`
    - Returns a `ListingResponse` with sorted file stems from `resources/words/*.txt`

1. Configuration Creation
    - Builds an initial `Config` based on user input
    - Selects default values if not explicitly set

2. Configuration Validation
    - `validate_config(config)` checks consistency:
        - Ensures compatibility between mode and file
        - Verifies presence of required assets (e.g., wordlists or quotes)
        - Adjusts invalid values (e.g., word count = 0 -> 25)
    - Returns a `ConfigResponse` with:
        - Possibly modified config
        - Optional validation message (info, warning, or error)
    - If validation level is `Error`, the program exits

3. Test Generation
    - `generate_content(config)` creates test content based on validated config
    - Returns a `GeneratorResponse` with:
        - Generated test words (`Vec<String>`)
        - Optional validation message (info, warning, or error)
    - If validation level is `Error`, the program exits

4. Test Execution
   - Typing test starts using current validated config
   - Handled interactively on UI side for more latency
   - Real-time input is processed and collected

5. Result Evaluation
   - Once test completed, raw test data (`RawResults`) is sent to the core block for analysis
   - Core computes performance metrics and make results
   - Final data `FinalResults` structure is returned, ready for display

## Core Structure

### `core/config.rs`
- Defines the configuration structure (`Config`) and validation logic (`validate_config`)
- Ensures correct mode usage and asset availability before test generation

### `core/generator.rs`
- Responsible for generating the actual test content based on the config  
- Supports reading words, quotes, or user-provided files
- Handles formatting logic (e.g., splitting quotes into words)

### `core/listing.rs`
- Provides listing functionality for both languages and color schemes
- Scans directories and returns file stem names as identifiers

### `core/results.rs`
- Provides core data structures `RawResults` for raw test data and `FinalResults` for final performance summary (accuracy, speed, etc.)
- `Key` is unified key representation:
   - in cli mapped from `crossterm::event::KeyEvent` using `fn convert_key(key: &KeyEvent)` in `cli/src/logic.rs`
   - in web should be mapped from js `KeyboardEvent`
- `Event` is single key press (event) representation:
   - `time` is time since test start:
      - in cli used `Instant::elapsed()`
      - in web should be used `performance.now()` delta
   - `correct` can be `true` / `false` / `None` (for system keys)
- `Word` represents a single test word with its associated input events
- Should be included logic for analyzing raw input and converting it into final results suitable for ui display

### `core/response.rs`
- Generic response structure (`Response<T>`) with support for levels: `Info`, `Warning`, and `Error`
- Used for returning payloads along with contextual messages
